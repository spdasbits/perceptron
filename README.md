1) High-level overview

This is a minimal custom Dense (fully-connected) layer implemented by subclassing tf.keras.layers.Layer.
It computes output = sigmoid(X · W + b) where:

X = input matrix (shape [batch_size, input_dim])

W = weight matrix ([input_dim, output_dim])

b = bias vector ([output_dim])

sigmoid = element-wise logistic activation

2) Line-by-line / concept-by-concept

import tensorflow as tf
Loads TensorFlow.

class MyDenseLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
You define a custom Keras layer by inheriting from Layer. Keras handles variable tracking, training/inference modes, saving, etc.

def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
Constructor. Here you pass input and output sizes. (Note: the more common pattern is to accept only units (output_dim) and create weights lazily in build() using the actual input_shape.)

super(MyDenseLayer, self).__init__()
Calls the parent constructor — required for correct layer behavior.

self.W = self.add_weight(...)
Creates a trainable variable (the weight/kernel). Important arguments:

shape=(input_dim, output_dim) — shape of the weight matrix.

initializer="random_normal" — Keras initializer used to fill initial values (default params: mean=0.0, stddev=0.05 if using the name; you can pass a tf.keras.initializers object for control).

trainable=True — included in layer.trainable_variables and updated by optimizers.

self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(output_dim,), initializer="zeros", ...)
Creates bias vector of shape (output_dim,). This shape broadcasts automatically when added to z of shape (batch_size, output_dim).

def call(self, inputs):
call() is the layer’s forward pass. When you run y = layer(x), call() executes.

z = tf.matmul(inputs, self.W) + self.b
Matrix multiply and add bias:

If inputs has shape (batch_size, input_dim) and W is (input_dim, output_dim), tf.matmul(inputs, W) → (batch_size, output_dim).

Adding b (shape (output_dim,)) broadcasts across the batch axis.

output = tf.math.sigmoid(z)
Applies the sigmoid activation elementwise: σ(t) = 1 / (1 + exp(-t)). Output values are in (0, 1).

return output
Return the tensor of shape (batch_size, output_dim).

Because W and b were created with trainable=True, they are updated by optimizers when you call model.fit(...) or apply gradients manually.

5) Practical tips and improvements
A — Use build() instead of creating weights in __init__

Recommended pattern: create weights in build(self, input_shape) so the layer can infer input_dim automatically. This makes the layer reusable when you don't know input size at construction.
